# Appendices

## A. Glossary of Terms

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
- **Blockchain**: A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology is primarily used to verify transactions within digital currencies though it is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain.
- **Arbitrum**: A layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables fast, low-cost, and secure transactions. It is designed to support all Ethereum Layer 1 contracts without any modifications and provides a massive increase in scalability over Layer 1.
- **Gen Z**: The demographic cohort succeeding Millennials and preceding Generation Alpha. Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years. Most members of Generation Z are the children of Generation X.
- **PvP (Player vs. Player)**: A type of multiplayer interactive conflict within a game between two or more live participants. This is often a mode in digital games in which players fight against each other in real-time.
- **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**: A type of cryptographic token on a blockchain that represents a unique item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis, NFTs are unique and not mutually interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same.
