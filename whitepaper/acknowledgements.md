We would like to express our deepest appreciation to all those who provided the possibility to complete this white paper. A special gratitude we give to our CEO, Michael Gruen, whose contribution in stimulating suggestions and encouragement, helped us to coordinate our project especially in writing this paper.

We are also immensely grateful to Doug Schaer, our CBO, for his comments on an earlier version of the manuscript, although any errors are our own and should not tarnish the reputations of these esteemed professionals.

Our sincere thanks also goes to Aditya Agrawal, Head of Engineering, for sharing his pearls of wisdom with us during the course of this research, and we thank '3 anonymous reviewers' for their so-called insights. We are also grateful to Marc Randolph and the entire advisory board for their insights and expertise that greatly assisted the research, although they may not agree with all of the interpretations/conclusions of this paper.

We must not forget to thank the team of Elysium Innovations for their constant support and for providing the necessary information regarding the project, and also for their help in offering a great place of work.

Finally, we would like to thank our families for their wise counsel and sympathetic ear. You are always there for us.
